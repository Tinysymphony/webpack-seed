##Webpack-Seed

#### Preface

I've created a repository last year aimed to provide an automatic development environment for front-end engineers who want to try React.

After several days' coding, the [workflow-starter](https://github.com/Tinysymphony/workflow-starter) based on Gulp / Webpack / Browser-sync was completed. It's kind of tedious that the whole flow needs to write files time after time because the Gulp watches the `src` folder and execute `webpack` task every time when we press the shortcut to save files.

I starred kriasoft's [react-starter-kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) in October last year, a more complete tool to build React App. At that time the project used Gulp with webpack which was the same as mine. Year gone by, kriasoft's project has been changed to a mature React-Webpack starter kit. I come to realize it's time to customize a brand new kit for myself.

This Webpack-Seed draws on the experiences of other brilliant projects, especially react-starter-kit.
